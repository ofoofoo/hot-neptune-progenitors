# Hot Neptune Progenitor Simulator

The MIT-led Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission has monitored millions of stars in the night sky for light fluctuations since it launched in 2018. Once these signals are filtered and classified as true exoplanet transits, it is important to conduct further statistical and  analytical work on the discovered systems to better understand their architectures, formation, and 
evolution. Recently, TESS has discovered a particularly interesting collection of planets in a rare part of parameter space. These planets reside in the so-called “Hot Neptune Desert”, a region of planet period-radius space characterized by a distinct underabundance of short-period Neptune-size 
planets. That is, these planets were previously thought to be entirely absent, but TESS has discovered that there are indeed a rare handful existing in the “desert”. The origins of these planets are currently a mystery. By constructing and testing hypotheses for how they formed, the 
planets in the Hot Neptune Desert offer a valuable opportunity to constrain planet formation and 
evolution processes. 

In particular, there are multiple recently-discovered systems with a particularly mysterious architecture, which are ideal case studies to explore the origins of the Hot Neptune Desert. We hypothesize that the systems were formed through collision-merger events within their inner systems that were prompted by dynamical upheaval in the outer system. 

We introduce an integrator machinery for creating multi-planetary systems that collide up into the Hot Neptune Desert.
